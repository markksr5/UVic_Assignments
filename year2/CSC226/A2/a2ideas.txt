build empty trees for prims and kruskals
add edge prim
add edge kruskal
check cycle prim
check cycle kruskal
continue if no cycle

how to check cycle
add the kruskal edge to prims tree and check if cycle
	check cycle:
	the added node MUST be the node that completes a cycle if the trees are different
	thus depth first search idea:
	u = either, v = other
	traverse through the nodes connected to v
	if x.other == u, then cycle
	if x doesn't lead anywhere for all x and x.other != u for any x, then no cycle found
vice versa (do we need this? i think so, at the very least we need to add the kruskal edge to the prim tree, since it is more
likely to have cycles?)

functions
add edge prim
add edge kruskal
check cycle prim (kruskal edge)
check cycle kruskal (prim edge)
