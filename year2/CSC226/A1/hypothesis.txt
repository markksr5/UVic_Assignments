When running 100 trials of the tests for n distinct random integers, with n = 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, these were the results found:

n = 10^4:
Percentage	Occurrences
21		1
22		18
23		51
24		29
25		1


n = 10^5:
Percentage	Occurrences
23		97
24		3


n = 10^6:
Percentage	Occurrences
23		100


Based on the results found as n increases, the expected percentage of red nodes in any red black tree is about 23%, with the percentage approaching 23% as n increases.
This is due to the observations:
	1) There are no two consecutive red nodes
		For any path from root to leaf, there can only be a maximum of 50% red nodes.
	2) There are no right leaning red links
		Since a red black tree is always complete (relative to black nodes), at least 50% of the nodes are black.
Due to this, it can be expected that there are no more than 25% red nodes in any given red black tree.  
This likely converges to a lower number because it is unlikely for red nodes to occupy ALL possible spots that red nodes can occupy.
